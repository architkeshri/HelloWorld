## Introduction:
### Inspiration
   Covid-19 pandemic has left us all cheerless about many things, one of which was the smothered curiousity and excitement of freshers about going to their new college. The newbies found it a little difficult to connect with their peers online, ask queries and make connections beyond the classrooms. This led us to the creation of MNNIT Sangam.  
### Solution
   MNNIT Sangam is an online platform for the MNNITians where they can interact even beyond the formal and physical barriers otherwise imposed due to the pandemic. It is a one stop solution to 
   1. Get all your college related queries answered and 
   2. Stay up-to-date with the college activities including clubs. 

It also plans to incorporate a feature to track the daily progress of the individuals so as to keep them motivated and help them organize their college life in a better and efficient way!
